# Frosty Copilot: Technical & Product Specification

---

## üåü Vision
Frosty Copilot is the natural language interface and AI assistant for iceOS, enabling users to create, edit, and understand complex, agentic workflows using plain English. Frosty bridges the gap between no-code/low-code UX and advanced agentic orchestration, making intelligent automation accessible, transparent, and collaborative.

---

## üß† Conceptual Requirements

### 1. Unified Agentic Abstraction
- Treat **nodes**, **tools**, **agents**, and **chains** as modular, composable building blocks.
- Enable seamless composition and reuse of these components.

### 2. Copilot-Driven Creation
- Users prompt Frosty in natural language.
- Frosty interprets intent and generates draft architectures (nodes, tools, agents, chains).
- Frosty explains its reasoning and design choices.

### 3. Scriptchain as a Product
- The primary deliverable is a **scriptchain**: a workflow of interconnected components.
- Scriptchains can be exported, run, deployed, and shared.

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration
- Users can review, edit, and re-prompt at any stage.
- Frosty supports iterative refinement and collaborative design.

### 5. Visual and Code-Based Interaction
- Canvas view for drag-and-drop composition and visualization.
- Code view for direct editing and advanced customization.

## üîë Key Features
- **Prompt-to-Workflow:** Users describe workflows in natural language; Frosty generates draft node/chain architectures, recommending AI Nodes or Agentic Nodes as appropriate.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Users can refine workflows via prompt or UI; Frosty updates and explains changes, and can suggest switching between node types for more determinism or autonomy.
- **Node Type Guidance:** Frosty explains the difference between AI Nodes (deterministic, single-step) and Agentic Nodes (autonomous, planning-capable, multi-step), and helps users choose the right type for each task.
- **Round-Trip Editing:** Seamless conversion between canvas (visual) and prompt (text) representations, with clear indication of node types.
- **Contextual Help:** Frosty answers "why" and "how" questions about any part of the workflow, including node type trade-offs.
- **Learning Loop:** Frosty learns from user edits and feedback to improve future suggestions.
- **Debugging & Suggestions:** Frosty helps debug workflows and suggests improvements, including when to use agentic nodes for more complex, open-ended tasks.

## üß© User Experience (UX)
1. **Onboarding:** Users are greeted by Frosty and prompted to describe their workflow.
2. **Drafting:** Frosty generates a visual workflow on the canvas, with explanations for each node/chain and why a node is AI or agentic.
3. **Editing:** Users can drag, drop, or prompt to modify the workflow; Frosty provides real-time feedback and node type recommendations.
4. **Explaining:** Users can ask Frosty to explain any node, chain, or the overall architecture, including the determinism/autonomy trade-off.
5. **Iterating:** Frosty suggests optimizations, including switching node types, and learns from user feedback.
6. **In-Node Work:** Users can open any node to edit prompts, tool schemas, agentic planning logic, or memory options, with Frosty assisting as needed.
7. **Execution & Debugging:** Users run the workflow, step through execution, inspect outputs, and use Frosty for error interpretation and fixes.

## üîå Integration Points
- **Canvas UI:** Frosty is embedded in the visual builder, enabling prompt-to-canvas and canvas-to-prompt workflows, with node type selection.
- **Node/Chain System:** Frosty leverages the standardized node/chain schemas for generation and explanation, supporting both node types.
- **Plugin System:** Frosty can suggest and integrate third-party nodes/tools, including agentic frameworks.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Design & Implementation
- **LLM Integration:** Uses the best available LLMs for prompt understanding and workflow generation.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to support new node types, tools, and providers as the platform evolves.
- **Observability:** All Frosty actions are logged for transparency and improvement.
- **Prompt-to-Architecture Engine:** Frosty interprets user prompts and generates draft architectures, presenting them in the canvas for review and refinement.
- **Versioning & Collaboration:** Supports versioning, undo/redo, and collaborative editing.
- **Execution & Evaluation:** Users can run scriptchains locally or in the cloud, monitor execution, debug, and evaluate performance with built-in logging and metrics.
- **Third-Party Integration:** Supports integration with external frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex) and plugin system for extensibility.

## üß© Example User Flow
1. **Prompt:**
   "Frosty, create a workflow that scrapes news headlines, summarizes them, and emails me the summary every morning."
2. **Frosty Drafts:**
   - Node: News Scraper
   - Tool: Summarizer (LLM)
   - Node: Email Sender
   - Chain: [Scraper] ‚Üí [Summarizer] ‚Üí [Email Sender]
3. **User Reviews in Canvas:**
   - Edits the summarizer prompt
   - Adds a filter node for specific topics
   - Re-prompts Frosty to optimize the chain
4. **User Runs & Monitors:**
   - Executes the chain, reviews logs, and refines as needed
