# iceOS Sprint Plan: Zoom Q&A MVP & Platform Foundation

---

## Overview
This sprint plan provides a detailed, phase-by-phase execution guide for building the iceOS platform and the Zoom Q&A Chat Assistant MVP. Each sprint is two weeks, with clear objectives, deliverables, and tasks. The plan is tightly cross-referenced with the [ENGINEERING_TODO.md](ENGINEERING_TODO.md) and [STRATEGY.md](../STRATEGY.md) documents, and is designed for engineering teams and technical stakeholders.

## Sprint 1: Core Platform & Node System
**Duration:** Weeks 1–2

### Objectives
- Establish project scaffolding, authentication, and project management.
- Implement/refine the core node system (BaseNode, AiNode, AgenticNode).
- Set up ScriptChain orchestration for both node types.

### Deliverables
- User authentication (login, registration, JWT/OAuth)
- Project/workspace CRUD
- BaseNode, AiNode, and AgenticNode classes (with factory)
- ScriptChain orchestration (parallelism, dependency management, error handling)
- Modular service architecture (LLM, Tool, Context, etc.)

### Tasks
- Set up monorepo, CI/CD, and code quality tools
- Implement user/project models and APIs
- Refine BaseNode and AiNode; implement AgenticNode
- Update node factory for both node types
- Extend ScriptChain for both node types
- Refactor services for dependency injection
- Write unit tests for node execution and chain orchestration

## Sprint 2: Visual Builder & Copilot Foundations
**Duration:** Weeks 3–4

### Objectives
- Build MVP visual workflow builder (canvas UI)
- Implement Frosty Copilot MVP (prompt-to-network, NL parsing)
- CRUD for networks, flows, chains, nodes

### Deliverables
- Drag-and-drop canvas for networks/flows/chains/nodes
- Node/chain/flow config panels (schema-driven)
- Frosty Copilot panel (prompt-to-canvas, basic NL parsing)
- Visualize execution flow, status, and errors
- CRUD UI and backend for all levels

### Tasks
- Design and implement canvas UI (React or preferred framework)
- Build config panels for node/chain/flow/network
- Integrate Copilot for prompt-to-structure generation
- Implement backend APIs for CRUD
- Add color/type labels for node types
- Write integration tests for UI/UX flows

## Sprint 3: Zoom Q&A Node Library & Orchestration
**Duration:** Weeks 5–6

### Objectives
- Implement all required nodes for Zoom Q&A workflow
- Build file watcher/automation triggers
- Develop basic frontend chat interface
- Add step-through debugging and output inspection

### Deliverables
- ZoomIngestionNode, AssetCollectorNode, TranscriptionNode, SpeakerDiarizationNode, ChatParserNode, FrameSamplerNode, OCRNode, WhiteboardParserNode, ChunkerNode, LinkerNode, EmbedderNode, IndexerNode, QueryEmbedderNode, RetrieverNode, RAGAgentNode, ReferenceFormatterNode
- FileWatcherNode and automation logic
- Frontend chat UI (connects to RAG/agentic chain)
- Step-through debugging in UI

### Tasks
- Implement each node as subclass/config of AiNode/AgenticNode
- Build file watcher and automation triggers
- Develop chat interface (frontend + backend integration)
- Add debugging/inspection UI for node outputs and agentic plans
- Write end-to-end tests for Zoom Q&A workflow

## Sprint 4: Marketplace, Export/Import, Analytics
**Duration:** Weeks 7–8

### Objectives
- Build marketplace for sharing/buying/selling networks, nodes, plugins
- Implement export/import for all workflow levels
- Add usage analytics and billing infrastructure

### Deliverables
- Marketplace UI and backend (browse, install, share, purchase)
- Export/import (JSON/YAML) for networks, flows, chains, nodes
- Usage tracking and billing logic

### Tasks
- Design and implement marketplace UI
- Build backend for listing, sharing, and purchasing assets
- Implement export/import logic and UI
- Integrate usage analytics (node runs, LLM calls, storage)
- Add billing and payment integration (Stripe or similar)
- Write tests for marketplace and export/import flows

## Sprint 5: Onboarding, Templates, Docs, Feedback Loop
**Duration:** Weeks 9–10

### Objectives
- Create onboarding flows and in-app documentation
- Add example templates (Zoom Q&A, sales analysis, etc.)
- Implement feedback collection and Copilot learning loop

### Deliverables
- Guided onboarding for new users
- Example workflow templates (importable)
- In-app documentation and troubleshooting
- Feedback UI and backend
- Copilot learning from user edits/feedback

### Tasks
- Build onboarding wizard and template browser
- Write and integrate documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Implement feedback collection (UI + backend)
- Connect Copilot to feedback/learning system
- Write tests for onboarding and template flows

**References:**
- [ENGINEERING_TODO.md](ENGINEERING_TODO.md#8-documentation-templates)

---

## Ongoing: QA, Security, Performance, Iteration
- Continuous bug fixing, refactoring, and user-driven improvements
- Security audits, input validation, and permission checks
- Performance tuning (caching, async, scaling)
- Weekly sprint reviews and planning

---

## Milestone: MVP Launch (End of Sprint 5)
